Save positions of k-mers and query sketch to skecht for this youu need metadata (len). just do rho1*rho2?
Sketch to sketch?
Better write/read binary blocks, perhaps with buffers, large chunks at once is bad for IO

Find conditions to not even check intervals (save some of the prefmax/suffmin ?)
lots of intervals use a lot of memory, keep it temp, at least across threshold clear stuff

? extract_intervals? correctness of the algorithm
? How to report intervals -- positions of k-mers?
? Remove m/r and splitting. Might make it much faster.
? How to treat Ns and skip positions
? Be careful about reverse complement coordinates!
? Postprocessing or be careful for +/- rc/fw in downstream analysis

=====
learn more about annotations? Colors?
Maybe don't ever zoom in on intevarls but show seletion also enable scrolling back mouse motions?
make the input compatbile and header aware.
