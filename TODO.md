Save positions of k-mers and query sketch to skecht for this youu need metadata (len). just do rho1*rho2?
Sketch to sketch?
Better write/read binary blocks, perhaps with buffers, large chunks at once is bad for IO

Find conditions to not even check intervals (save some of the prefmax/suffmin ?)
lots of intervals use a lot of memory, keep it temp, at least across threshold clear stuff

### Correctness of the algorithm:
For an interval (a, b) to be maximal (not properly contained in any larger negative-sum interval):

Left endpoint must be a running max: If ∃ a' < a with fdps_v[a'] >= fdps_v[a], then (a', b) has sum fdps_v[b] - fdps_v[a'] <= fdps_v[b] - fdps_v[a] < 0. So (a', b) also has negative sum and properly contains (a, b) → not maximal.
Right endpoint must be the farthest: If ∃ b' > b with (a, b') negative, then (a, b') properly contains (a, b) → not maximal.
Algorithm Correctness
The algorithm does exactly this:

Line 96-98: Only considers a where fdps_v[a] > fdpmax_v[a-1] (running maxima)
Lines 100-102: Finds rightmost b_star where (a, b_star) could have negative sum (using suffix minima)
Line 109-111: Verifies (a, b_star) actually has negative sum
Line 113-115: b_prev tracking ensures each b_star is claimed by the leftmost valid a
Line 117: Left-maximality check confirms no (a', b_star) with a' < a has negative sum
Linear Time
Outer loop: O(n)
b_curr only increases (never resets), total increments ≤ n−1
Total: O(n)
Verification with Counterexample
My earlier example fdc_v = [1, -3, 2, -1]:

(3, 4) has sum = −1, but (1, 4) also has negative sum and contains (3, 4)
So (3, 4) is NOT maximal under your definition
The algorithm correctly outputs only (1, 4) ✓
Conclusion
The algorithm is correct for finding all maximal (not contained in larger) negative-sum intervals in O(n) time. The comments are somewhat misleading (e.g., "a is a prefix maxima" should say "skip if a is NOT a new record high"), but the logic is sound.
#### Completeness
Yes, it finds **all** maximal intervals. Here's the proof:

### Completeness Proof

Let `(a*, b*)` be any maximal negative-sum interval. We show the algorithm outputs it.

**Step 1**: `a*` must be a running maximum.
- If not, `∃ a' < a*` with `fdps_v[a'] ≥ fdps_v[a*]`
- Then `(a', b*)` has sum ≤ `(a*, b*)` sum < 0
- So `(a', b*)` contains `(a*, b*)` with negative sum → contradicts maximality

**Step 2**: `b*` must equal `b_star` (the rightmost found by the algorithm for `a*`).
- `b_star` = rightmost `b` where `(a*, b)` has negative sum
- If `b* < b_star`, then `(a*, b_star)` contains `(a*, b*)` with negative sum → contradicts maximality
- So `b* = b_star`

**Step 3**: The `b_prev` check passes.
- If `b_prev == b*`, some earlier `a < a*` claimed `b*`
- That means `(a, b*)` was output, which contains `(a*, b*)` with negative sum → contradicts maximality
- So `b_prev ≠ b*`

**Step 4**: The left-maximality check passes.
- If `fdps_v[b*] < fdpmax_v[a*-1]`, then `∃ a' < a*` with `fdps_v[a'] > fdps_v[b*]`
- So `(a', b*)` has negative sum and contains `(a*, b*)` → contradicts maximality
- So the check passes

**Conclusion**: All checks pass → `(a*, b*)` is output. ∎

---
The algorithm is **complete**: every maximal interval is found, none are missed.
